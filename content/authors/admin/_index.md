  Having equipped myself with a broad scientific background on computer science and machine learning, I worked for 2 years as a PhD researcher at Group Neurophysiology of KU Leuven, carrying out research on deep Convolutional Neural Networks and their similarities with the visual system. See publications list.  
   
   Next, I worked as a Data Scientist for approximately a year in a small - at that time - startup called Faktion in Antwerp. There I became familiar with various Industry practices and applications including: setting up end-to-end ML pipelines, training models for AI tasks, creating deployable Docker containers, setting up Cloud components and participating in 2 hackathons, winning one of them.  
    
   Currently, I am back to working as a PhD Researcher at MeBioS, KU Leuven. In this department I am using Machine Learning to build smart automated insect-monitoring systems that require high real-world performance using data captured by optical  sensors. I contribute to multiple stages of each project, from data gathering and annotation to data analysis and model building. Having already finished my PhD requirements, I am expected to graduate on October 2022.
